## Introduction

An exploration of the Vancouver Police Departmentâ€™s public crime
database. This project uses the R language.

## Data Sources

The data set is freely available for download at [The VPD Open Data
Website](https://geodash.vpd.ca/opendata/). Save the zip file and
extract it into a directory called `data`. Ensure the data is named
`crimedata_csv_all_years.csv`

## Processing the Raw Data

[In this section]() we process the VPD crime dataset, Vancouver map
data, and census information and export a number of files we can use in
other contexts, like Tableau or natively in R.
